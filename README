This builds a small binary that helps set up sandboxed NICOS dry runs.
It needs to be compiled because scripts with shebang interpreters cannot
be setuid.

Requires Linux kernel and headers at least version 2.6.32.

For a full description of functionality, see the comment at the top of
nicos-sandbox-helper.c.
